The [HNX broker](http://bb1.hnx.helix-nebula.eu) was deployed into production in May 2014. It is now heavily used by CERN and others. The broker is a self-registrer and self-provisioning engine, giving its users access to a range of IaaS cloud providers.


The following IaaS providers are currently connected to the platform: 

 * [Atos / Canopy](http://atos.net)
 * [ExoScale](http://exoscale.ch)
 * [T-Systems](http://t-systems.com)
 * [Ultimum](https://ulticloud.com)
 
The broker is based on [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream) and operated by [SixSq](http://sixsq.com). Usage of the broker is free of charge at the point of delivery. This means users only pay for their cloud usage, based on the the service catalog pricing available from the broker.

[The Server Labs](http://www.theserverlabs.com) provides an Amazon EC2 bridge service, connected to the broker, which means you can access the broker using Amazon EC2 tools.
